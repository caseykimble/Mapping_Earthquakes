# Mapping_Earthquakes

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

### Method 

To complete this project, data was pulled from the USGS site in the form of a GeoJSON file that showed information for earthquake coordinates and magnitudes over the last secen days. Data was then added to a map with markers to show variations in magnitude based on the size of the marker, as well as tectonic plate lines and major earthquakes. JavaScript and the D3.js library were used to retrieve coordinates and magnitudes from the GeoJSON file. I then followed Leaflet documentation to plot the data on the map via an API request and add styling and interactivity.
